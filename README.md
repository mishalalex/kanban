## What is a kanban board?
A kanban board is a project management tool where you can add tasks into columns where each column is designated into a stage. Kanban boards are quite useful as it gives a high level overview of the current status of the project in terms of what are the pending tasks, what is being worked at and what is completed so far. 
By building a kanban board from scratch, my aim is to refresh my HTML, Javascript and DOM manipulation knowledge.
